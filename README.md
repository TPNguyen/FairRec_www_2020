# Two-Sided Fairness for Personalized Recommendations in Two-Sided Platforms
## Running FairRec
```python
python fairrec_algorithm.py google_local_fact.csv 10 0.5
```
There are three arguments here.<br>
* path to csv file with relevance scores (rows: customers, columns: producers)<br>
e.g., google_local_fact.csv
* size of recommendation or _k_<br>
* value of ```tex $\alpha$``` (our producer-side guarantee will be $\alpha$MMS)
## Relevance Scores
You can use the relevance scores estimated in your dataset in csv format (rows: customers, columns: producers) for your application scenario. Alternatively you can test with ours. The relevance scores calculated for the datasets (used in the paper) can be found in the following links in zipped csv format.
